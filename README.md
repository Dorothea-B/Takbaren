This was the final project for the Technigo Bootcamp, 
a full-stack project built by Dorothea Barre, Marianne Ardin, and Mimmi Fordal Uddin.


The idea for this project was to create a web page to help a local hotel advertise its rooftop bar in a better way. Today they only have it as a sub-page to their restaurant. We saw its potential, looked over what could be improved, and had ideas for future extensions.

We created this project using React, React routes, APIs from open weather and Instagram, PWA, and the headless CMS Sanity. Working with a PWA and sanity was new to us, we didn't learn it in the Bootcamp. So it was a new and fun challenge for us!

The brief included:
Frontend in React
Backend in Node.js
Database
Should work in Chrome, Firefox & Safari
Be responsive and work well on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

We made it a PWA to give it better SEO,  for better accessibility, and for the future if they want to use notifications or involve the hotel and its guests. 

We decided to use sanity as our backend. We wanted our client to be able to easily change the content of the web page and get involved in what to display. They can change all the images, text sections and their fonts/sizes.
