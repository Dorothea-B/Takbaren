Final project
A project built by Dorothea Barre, Marianne Ardin and Mimmi Fordal Uddin.
This was the final project for the Technigo bootcamp. The project has both back- and frontend. We built the backend using APIs and Sanity. In the frontend we worked in React and with branches. The site is a PWA.
The brief included:
Frontend in React
Backend in Node.js
Database
Should work in Chrome, Firefox & Safari
Be responsive and work well on mobile, tablet and desktop
The challenge
Headless CMS was not part of the boocamp course so we spent the first few day sof our project learning about Sanity before we started building the project.
We hade to make a few tweaks to make the sliding function work. Stretch goal.

Our full stack final project was built by ...
The idea for this project was to create a web page to help a local hotel advertise its rooftop bar in a better way. Today they only have it as a sub-page to their restaurant. We saw its potential, looked over what could be improved, and had ideas for future extensions.
We created this project using React, React routes, PWA, and the headless CMS Sanity. Working with a PWA and sanity was new to us and nothing we had learned in the Bootcamp so we had to learn by ourselves.
We made it as a PWA to give it better SEO,  for better accessibility, and in the future if they want to use notifications or involve the hotel and its guests.
We decided to use sanity as our backend, we wanted our client to be able to easily change the content of the web page and get involved in what to display. They can change all the images, and text sections and their fonts/sizes.
